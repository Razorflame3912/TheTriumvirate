PLAN FOR MAY 31ST 2017

In order of greatest importance:

0. Blocks collide with projectiles, the floor, and one another in a realistic manner

1. Represent Blocks with rectangles to hide underlying circles (already achieved, but further testing required following changes made in task 0)

2. Successfully load a Level that contains several Blocks that stack in a stable orientation

ex:

	[][][][][]
	[]	[]
	[]	[]
	[]	[]
	[]	[]
